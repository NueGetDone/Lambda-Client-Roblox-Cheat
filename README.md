# Lambda Client — External Mod Client

Lambda Client is a fully external, terminal-user-interface cheat client built for the
Roblox sandbox environment. Designed for reliability, stability, and
multi-game flexibility, Lambda delivers high-precision visual tools and
aim-enhancement systems without needing drivers, kernel access, or elevated
permissions.

Lambda runs 100% in usermode, making it lightweight, portable, and safe to
launch on any standard system.

# 🚀 Features
## 🎯 Aim Assist

Lambda includes a configurable aim-assist engine allowing users to fine-tune
their preferred level of automation.

You can choose any value between 0.0 and 1.0:

1.0 — Full lock-on behavior

0.0 — Zero mouse movement

0.1–0.9 — Smooth, controlled, human-like targeting

This gives you full control over whether you prefer subtle aim smoothing or
maximum strength snap-to-target locking.

##🟦 ESP — Corner Boxes

Lambda’s ESP system renders clean, minimalistic corner boxes around visible
targets. The design focuses on clarity, performance, and readability, ensuring
you always maintain instant visual awareness of nearby entities.

➤ Tracers

Lambda can draw directional tracers from the center of your screen to
on-screen targets. This provides immediate directional awareness and helps track
positions even in fast-paced scenes or cluttered environments.
