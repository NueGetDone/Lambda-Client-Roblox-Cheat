# Lambda Client — External Mod Client

Lambda Client is a fully external, terminal-user-interface cheat client built for the
Roblox sandbox environment. Designed for reliability, stability, and
multi-game flexibility, Lambda delivers high-precision visual tools and
aim-enhancement systems without needing drivers, kernel access, or elevated
permissions.

Lambda runs 100% in usermode, making it lightweight, portable, and safe to
launch on any standard system.

# 🚀 Features
## 🎯 Aim Assist / Aimbot

Lambda includes a configurable aim-assist engine allowing you to configure the settings to your
preferred level of automation.

You can choose any value between 0.0 and 1.0:

1.0 — Full lock-on behavior

0.0 — No mouse movement

0.1–0.9 — Options to make the aimbot not quite lock on, but still assist you.

## 🟦 ESP — Corner Boxes

Lambda’s ESP system renders corner boxes around other players, showing you where they are, even behind walls.

## ➤ Tracers

Lambda can draw tracers from the center of your screen to
other players, showing you both the direction of enemies around you and their movement.

## ⌨️ Custom Keybinds

Every module in Lambda can be mapped to any key you choose.

## 🔄 Persistent Process Attachment

Lambda remains attached to the running sandbox session, even during teleports and game changes.

## 🧩 No drivers required

Lambda requires no driver, no kernel access, and no boot-time setup.
This means there is no need to setup external drivers or use specific boot modes to run the application.
